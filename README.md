# Alumni Registration System

## Project Overview
The Alumni Registration System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the registration of alumni. This system consists of a user-friendly web front-end for alumni registration, a robust back-end to handle data processing, and a well-designed database to store alumni information.

## Project Structure

### 1. Deliverable #1: Software
#### a. Web Front-End
- The web front-end allows users to register alumni by searching for graduation year and name.
- Additional details such as contact information, further educational qualifications, and organizations (selected from a dropdown) along with positions can be added during registration.

#### b. Back-End Software
- The back-end is implemented as per the design covered in class, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### 2. Deliverable #2: Database Design
#### a. Conceptual Design
- The conceptual design is represented using a class diagram, focusing on classes relevant to the system's functionality.

#### b. Logical Design
- The logical design involves Object-Relational (OR) mapping of the class diagram, ensuring a seamless transition from the conceptual model to the database.

#### c. Implementation Design
- The implementation design is provided in the form of database scripts:
  - `create_tables.sql`: Defines the structure of the database tables.
  - `alter_tables.sql`: Includes any necessary alterations to the tables.
  - `insert_data.sql`: Populates the database with initial data.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Set up the database using the provided scripts in the `database` directory.
3. Configure the back-end to connect to the database.
4. Start the web server to deploy the front-end.
5. Access the application in your web browser.
